# Redux presentation

## Plan
Workshop presentations, code as you speak. Make them inspired with awe.

## Scope
1) **Redux Store box** (most simple redux model (subscribe, dispatch))
2) **Reducer** as function (ternary, if, switch)
3) **Action** as object and Action creator
4) **UI** simple rendering function (adder, list -> AJAX list)
5) **Rules of redux** reducers as **pure** functions, immutability, non-async nature 
6) **Combine reducer** manually -> show purpose
7) **Middleware** async actions
8) **Unsubscribe** for Gods sake!
